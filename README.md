# Impacts plugin

## This release migrates the data from the former version of this plugin into the GLPI 9.5 core tables.
As a consequence, it no longer manages the impact analysis as it is now managed by the GLPI core since version 9.5,

## But, via a dropdown named "Impact Itemstypes", it gives possibility to:
1. Add any GLPI object types (or any plugin object types) into the list of enabled types for impact analysis.
2. Change the icons for GLPI core item types (or for plugin item types).
See the dropdowns list in the Setup menu
